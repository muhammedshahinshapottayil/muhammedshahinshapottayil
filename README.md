# 🚀 Blockchain Developer | Pioneering the Future of Web3

## 👨‍💻 My Coding Journey

As a curious computer science student, I embarked on a transformative coding journey, fueled by an unwavering passion for software development. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis, which led to dropping out of college, I turned adversity into opportunity. With resilience and dedication, I took charge of my learning, determined to turn my dreams into reality.

### Early Beginnings

Starting with the fundamentals of C, I quickly expanded my skill set to include C# and PHP. Each language added a new dimension to my abilities, forming a strong foundation in diverse technologies. Driven by an insatiable desire to learn and grow, I joined a small company where I balanced real-world projects with studying the MERN stack. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, successfully converting company projects.

### Boot Camp and Advanced Learning

My journey took a quantum leap forward when I attended a boot camp in Bangalore. Here, I not only refined my MERN stack skills but also delved into advanced concepts like microservices, Docker, and Kubernetes. This intensive learning experience was a game-changer, arming me with cutting-edge skills and a profound understanding of modern software development.

### Passion for Blockchain

In Bangalore, I discovered my true calling: blockchain technology. The introduction to blockchain, particularly Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) development, ignited a spark within me. Driven by curiosity, I immersed myself in programs like speedrunethereum.com and became an integral part of BuidlGuidl's esteemed Batch 3. This journey deepened my expertise in blockchain, empowering me to master Solidity, Yul, and frameworks like Foundry, Hardhat, and Scaffold ETH 2.
